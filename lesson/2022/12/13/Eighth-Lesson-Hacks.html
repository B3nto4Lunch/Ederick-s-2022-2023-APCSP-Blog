<h3 id="Hack-#1">Hack #1<a class="anchor-link" href="#Hack-#1"> </a></h3><p>Create an idea for a simulation and describe it (you don’t actually have to code it just think about/answer the guiding questions).</p>
<ul>
<li>An idea for a simulation could be:<ul>
<li>A company wants to give their product and business more attraction, but they do not know how much money to spend on advertising (Where they will post their flyers in multiple locations and billboards) and do not want to spend too much money, so they are trying to find the optimal amount of flyers and money to spend. They create a simulation where in each location that their posters are placed, 1 in every 200 people will call the business/product and 1 in every 1300 people will buy the business/product. They have the populations for every location their advertisements are in and run it. This is a simulation because it is similar to real life, but is not as accurate as an actual experiment because there can't be a definite probability that a person will be interested in said product. However, the simulation will save a lot more time and money at the cost of its imminent inaccuracy. </li>

<h3 id="Hack-#3">Hack #3<a class="anchor-link" href="#Hack-#3"> </a></h3><p>Describe the rolling dice simulation (answer guiding questions)</p>
<ul>
<li>What makes it a simulation? <ul>
<li>The simulation is, well, a simulation is because the results that the dice outputs will not always be the same and therefore it emulates that of real life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What are it’s advantages and disadvantages?<ul>
<li>The advantage is that the results that the computer outputs can be more time efficient, and can save money (if someone is being payed and such to roll the dice at random). However, the dice game may not be as accurate as a real life demonstrate because of some variable or factor (like the face the dice is being rolled at, height above the surface, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In your opinion, would an experiment be better in this situation?
  In my opinion, the dice as a simulation would be better because you can receive a large amount of data from the simulation that would otherwise be similar to an experiment -- random -- and in addition save some time.</li>

ex: a 14-sided dice or expand the purpose of the simulation (hint: use conditionals to make dice part of a game/real life situation)
