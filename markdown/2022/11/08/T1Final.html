<p>Overall, I got 46/50 on the final for the first trimester. For the first problem that I got incorrect, Q29, it was a basic question on lists. Instead of clicking the correct answer,  Lists are data abstractions that allow multiple elements to be stored in a single collection, I stated that lists were able to update all user inputs.</p>

<p>The next question was incorrect was Q43, where it was asking for the value of X. I got this wrong because I chose 6 because I thought the repeating values would be enough to make x = x + 1 multiple times until x would be more than 5. However, apparently you need 15 to get it correctly. I never knew.</p>

<p>The next question that I got incorrect was Q44. This had to do with a MOD question. I did not know what mod was originally, but after searching it up (modulo), I think I can confidently answer this one in the future.</p>

<p>The last question that I got wrong was question 50, where I hadto understand concat values. I am still confused on how to do this function properly, but hopefully I will understand it in the future</p>
