# Night at the Museum

This night was very spectacular, and I think that there were many elaborate and complex pieces of art that were very inspiring and clearly required lots of time and effort doing. Here are some of the examples that I came across.

The first thing that I came across when touring all of the difference spectactles at the museum was the ceramics room. Ceramics has always been a very interesting elective to me, and I wish I could have taken it in Freshman year. However, a lot of people do tell me how difficult it is due to the amount of attention to detail and skill required to craft such spectacles. I came across this amazingly done squid. I thought it reminded me of a kraken!

Next, onto the Photography class! This time, I went to my friend (and also star swimmer) Julien Rousseu! His sister drives kinda badly, so he took a hilarious photo of two cars, opposite in color, standing in the parking lot. Talk about the duality of opposites! Not only are they different colors and directions, they are also different brands!
