# Night at the Museum

This night was very spectacular, and I think that there were many elaborate and complex pieces of art that were very inspiring and clearly required lots of time and effort doing. Here are some of the examples that I came across.

The first thing that I came across when touring all of the difference spectactles at the museum was the ceramics room. Ceramics has always been a very interesting elective to me, and I wish I could have taken it in Freshman year. However, a lot of people do tell me how difficult it is due to the amount of attention to detail and skill required to craft such spectacles. I came across this amazingly done squid. I thought it reminded me of a kraken!

Next, onto the Photography class! This time, I went to my friend (and also star swimmer) Julien Rousseu! His sister drives kinda badly, so he took a hilarious photo of two cars, opposite in color, standing in the parking lot. Talk about the duality of opposites! Not only are they different colors and directions, they are also different brands!

Finally, the moment you have all been waiting for! The Computer Science Projects! This time I viewed my friend Yuri's food tracking project and a video game project! 
- The first project, Yuri's project, has some amazing CSS and some amazing features. After logging in, all you have to do is search up what you want to cook, and all the recipes and DIYs will show up and can be stored in a DB! It is very complex and really demonstrates their time and effort!
- The second project that I saw was an 8-bit arcade style based game, where you can play the iconic game, snake! Basically, a snake is controlled by the player and its goal is to collect all the food (red bits) until the snake is either too long to move anywhere or it hits the wall or collapses in on itself. There is also a really cool leaderboard and such that displays records, and because its retro, each user is only three letters (characters) long!
