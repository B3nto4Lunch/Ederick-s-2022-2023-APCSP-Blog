# Objectives
- Students understand and comprehend the idea of metadata
- Students can differentiate the significance and importance of different sets of information related to the user in a profile
- Emphasize the importance of documenting their code when adding data related to users. Teach learners how to write comments, document functions, and follow best practices for documenting their code, to ensure that their code is readable, maintainable, and understandable to others.
- Understand how data is stored and safely secured.
- Understanding that Data can be altered to update, change, or delete.

# Introducton (5 - 10 mins)

In order to accomplish this, we will first want to debrief what adding data related to the user *is*. So, to start with, we need to start by 
outlining the crucial ideas or key points that will be needed to be digested by the audience. Since it's *adding data related to user*, this can be some of the following:
- Metadata in contemporary or classical works, whether it be a picture or a literary text
- Personal Information (What to post, what not to)
    - This includes:
        - DoB
        - Occupation
        - HS Attended
        - Year Graduated
        - Credit Card Number
        - SSN (Social Security Number)
        - etc.
    - Obviously, these are just a few of the many examples that can be used as personal data when adding data related to the user.

    # Extracting Information from Data

    - The ability to process information depends on the capabilities of the user and their tools
    - Regardless of size, data sets will compose challenges (need for clean data, incomplete, invalid, or the need to combine data)
    - If data is combined, it may not be the same
    - Problems of bias often occur when collected data related to a specific subject.
