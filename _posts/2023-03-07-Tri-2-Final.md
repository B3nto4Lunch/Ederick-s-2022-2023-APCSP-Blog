I got 49/50 on my MCQ

I got question 49 wrong. This was a question based on simulations. It asked what a simulation does that is worse than a real life experiment. I genuinely did not know what "omit" meant, so I thought when it said "omits details so it's easier to implement," I thought it was something positive rather than negative. Therefore, I got it wrong. Omit actually means to leave out.
