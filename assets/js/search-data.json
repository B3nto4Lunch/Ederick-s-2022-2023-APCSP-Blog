Iteration Statements: change the sequential flow of control by repeating a set of statements zero or more times, until a stopping condition is met . Repeat Until: if the condition evaluates to true initially, the loop body is not executed at all, due to the condition being checked before the loop. . Stopping conditions can stop an interaction if it was already met. . Definition: Iteration Statement - cause statements to be executed zero or more times, subject to some loop-termination criteria . range function gives the range for the variable . a = 1 for a in range(2,10): print(a) . 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . Breaking statements can also be used to break a loop. Conditions can be constantly used in lists that are not numbers. . animals = [&quot;dog&quot;, &quot;cat&quot;, ] for i in animals: if i == &quot;fish&quot;: break print(i) # Make piece of code that gives three different recommendations for possible classes to take at a school based on two different conditions.

List Operations: write expressions that use list indexing and list procedures. . Traversing Lists: all elements in the list are assessed, or a partial traversal, where only a portion of elements are accessed (can be complete). . Complete Traversal: All elements in a list are assessed Partial Traversal: Only a given portion of elements are assessed Iterative Traversal: When loops are used to iterate through a list and to access each single element at a time. . insert( ) allows a value to be inserted into a list at index i | append( ) allows a value to be added at the end of a list | remove( ) allows an element at index i to be deleted from a list | length( ) returns the number of elements currently in a specific list | . 3.9 and 3.11 Algorithms . Three components of an Algorithm: . Selection | Sequence | Iteration | . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still create the same thing. . It is important to notice the differences in the algorithms to see if there are any errors that can occur . Tommy and Billy are working on solving the same issue with an algorithm Tommy creates a functioning code and yells &quot;I did it!&quot; He looks over at his friend Billy which is having a bit of trouble and he offers help However, Billy&#39;s code looks basically the same! which confuses them Then they remember that they were taught that algorithms that look similar don&#39;t always have the same results and they collaborate to do further investigation:) . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) A = grade &gt;= 90 B = 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90 C = grade &lt; 70 if A: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif B: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif C: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . The code above does look different from the first two, but it is the same thing, where instead of the number being identified, it is being identified through the letter that it is given. Does the same thing, but uses a different method to find said grade. . Developing Algorithms . When creating an algorithm, it is good to outline its process before coding to ensure that it is sequenced correctly (the steps taken to derive your answer) . Visualization helps one see the flow of the whole algorithm | More efficient and effective | . . Algorithms with iteration repeat functions until a goal is fulfilled. . Algorithms with selection will only go through certain functions if certain things are true or false . An example of visualization is shown below . Start | Input number of hours parked | If hours is less than 1, cost is free | If hours is between 1 and 2, cost is $5 | If hours is between 2 and 3, cost is $8 | If hours is between 3 and 4, cost is $10 | If hours is more than 4, cost is $12 | Display cost and goodbye | Finish | print(&quot;The parking rate is as follows: n Less than one hour: Free n 1-2 hours: $5 n 2-3 hours: $8 n 3-4 hours: $10 n 4+ hours: $12&quot;) time = float(input(&quot;How many hours have you parked at this garage?&quot;)) print(&quot;How many hours have you parked at this garage?&quot;) print(time, &quot;hours costs:&quot;) if time &lt; 1 : print(&quot;Free&quot;) elif time &gt;= 1 and time &lt; 2 : print(&quot;$5&quot;) elif time &gt;= 2 and time &lt; 3 : print(&quot;$8&quot;) elif time &gt;= 3 and time &lt; 4 : print(&quot;$10&quot;) else: print(&quot;$12&quot;) print(&quot;Have a good day!&quot;) . Notice how the algorithm is planned out before creating, making it more efficient and less prone to errors. . To use preexisting algorithms, knowing some can help construct new ones . simple existing algorithms include determining the min and max of 2+ numbers | Computing sum or average | identifying if an integer is even or odd Using existing algorithms structures can help as building blocks to reduce the time to develop, testing, and errors. | . | . Binary Search . The binary search algorithm starts at the middle of a sorted data set of numbers and eliminates half of the data; this process repeats until the desired value is found or all elements have been eliminated. However, data must be sorted order to use this algorithm (set of instructions to solve something) | Binary searching is oftentimes more efficient than sequential/linear search when applied to sorted data. | . Computers line up values in order and search sequentially down the line, one at a time. This is called a sequential search because each element in a list is examined starting with the first element until we find the desired target or reach the end of the list. The elements do not need to be in any order to do a sequential search. If you are searching for a number in the middle of 7 values, it would take four comparisons to find it. . Steps for Binary Search . 1. Start by placing the numbers in order (ascending or descending, both work). 2. Look at the middle number first 3. The middle number is determined by taking the highest index (the order of it) number and the lowest and divide by two. If we have 7 numbers placed in order, the first and last&#39;s places are added together, so 1+7/2 = 4. If the number is greater than the middle it will take the middle of the middle index and last index and will continue in this process. . This is similar to Divide and Conquer If you have 600 sorted numbers. you would go in this process 600/2 = 300(middle) 300/2 = 150 150/2 = 75 (Always round up) 75/2 = 38 19/2 = 10 5/2 = 3 3/2 = 2 2/2 = 1 &lt;-- the answer . You can also conduct a binary search on lists with words in alphabetical order. For example, . Fruit = [&quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Banana&quot; , &quot;Kiwi&quot;, &quot;Mango&quot; , &quot;Strawberry&quot;] To find Mango you need to go to the middle and look at Kiwi and then Mango second, it is the arithmetic of the index number that will determine the element you are looking at. . 3.12 and 3.13 . procedure: a named set of instructions that can take in parameters and return values. It can also be called method or function in different programming languages. . Parameter: independent variables used in the procedure to produce a result It allows a procedure to execute without initially knowing specific input values . Return Function in Python . To determine the result of a procedure or any code, you must follow the code line by line and see what each one does . Using syntax, you can determine the result by . function parameters return value and statements To use return values, you have to write the syntax return followed by the expression you would like to return var A return statement exits a function and instructs python to continue executing the program and to return a certain value . Value can be string, a tuple, or any other type that is being sent back to the main program . Ex: . We use the Return function will assign the values for the variables. Try it below with and without the return result. The code basically defines the function as find_cube(num), but in order for it to update it the result, we use the return (variable) for it . return (&quot;what is being called, in this case the result&quot;)(this is also called the parameter) . def find_cube(num): result = bin(num * num * num) return result cube = find_cube(3) cube2 = find_cube(4) print(&#39;Cube:&#39;,cube) print(&#39;Cube:&#39;,cube2 ) . Cube: 0b11011 Cube: 0b1000000 . Modularity - the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program | Abstraction - the practice of hiding the details of how a particular code or system works and exposing only the essential features or functions that are necessary for other parts of the program to use | Duplication - having multiple duplicate code blocks, often decreasing readability and efficiency | Logic - the sequence of steps and operations that a computer follows to | . Parameters are used to manage complexity calling functions with procedure names . Vocab . Procedure: a module of code that is created to complete a certain tasks, also known as a function | Procedure Name: the name that is given to the function/procedure | Parameter: a variable (independent) that is used in a function to allow for data to be important into said function | Arguments: A way to provide information to a function usually defined outside a function and then important into a function with parameters. | . Example Below: . def function(a,b): # function is defined print(a+b) # prints output of variables function(1,2) # one instance that it can be used function(2,3) # another instance . 3 5 . a and b are the parameters . def InchestoFeet(inches): Feet = inches/12 return Feet result = InchestoFeet(24) print(result) . 2.0 . Vocab for the Week 2 . Bits, Bytes, Hexadecimal / Nibbles . Bits - A given byte contains either bits or a code. A designation of &#39;bits&#39; means that each individual bit has its own meaning, independent of the meaning of other bits in the byte. | Byte - code is computer object code that an interpreter converts into binary machine code so it can be read by a computer&#39;s hardware processor. | Hexadecimal - relating to or using a system of numerical notation that has 16 rather than 10 as its base. | Nibble - a nibble is four consecutive binary digits or half of an 8-bit byte. | . . Unsigned Integer, Signed Integer, Floating Point . Unsigned Integer - Unsigned Integers (often called &quot;uints&quot;) are just like integers (whole numbers) but have the property that they don&#39;t have a + or - sign associated with them | Signed Integer - A signed integer is a 32-bit datum that encodes an integer in the range [-2147483648 to 2147483647]. | Floating Point - There are two floating point primitive types. Data type float is sometimes called &quot;single-precision floating point&quot;. Data type double has twice as many bits and is sometimes called &quot;double-precision floating point&quot;. | . . Binary Data Abstractions: Boolean, ASCII, Unicode, RGB . Boolean - True or False statements | ASCII - ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet. | Unicode - an international encoding standard for use with different languages and scripts, by which each letter, digit, or symbol is assigned a unique numeric value that applies across different platforms and programs. | RGB - Red Green Blue (Gamer) | . . Data Compression: Lossy, Lossless (note discussed yet) . Lossy - Lossy is a data encoding and compression technique that deliberately discards some data in the compression process. | Lossless - With lossless compression, every bit of data originally in a file remains after it is uncompressed, and all the information is restored | .",

            "content": "Essential Knowledge (College Board&#39;s Must Knows): . A variable is an abstraction inside a program that holds a value, where each variable has associated data storage that represents a single value at a time (However, if the value is a collection type such as a list, then the value can contain multiple values). | Variables typically have meaningful names that helps with the overall organization of the code and understanding of what is being represented by the variables | Some programming languages provide a variety of methods to represent data, which are referenced using variables (Booleans, numbers, lists, and strings) | One form of a value is better suited for representation than another. | . What is a Variable? . A variable is an abstraction made inside a program that holds a value. These variables are used in code to refer to more complex values that the variable contains and makes the program code more organized and smoother to run. . Variables can be seen as &quot;containers&quot; and each container has a name that holds what it is supposed to hold. In the following code, we can see that a variable has the value of &quot;Alex.&quot; How can we make the variable appear more organized in the code? . x = &quot;Alex&quot; print(x + &quot;likes pie.&quot;) # Make it so that &quot;x&quot; is easier to identify to the user . Choosing Variables . When choosing variables, it is important to assign the variables name to something that correlates with what the function of the variable is supposed to do. For example, we do not want a variable that is supposed to hold a name be named &quot;age&quot; becaue it can be confusing and mistakes may be more prevalent. . age = &quot;Timothy&quot; name = &quot;39&quot; # Notice how age is going to be seen when printing the code. That can lead to confusion print(name + &quot; is &quot; + age) . 39 is Timothy . Data Types . Variables have different data types that store specific kinds of data depending on what is being represented. Some examples are shown below: . integer (numbers) | string (or text/letters) | Boolean (True/False statements) | . These types of data types can be useful when trying to represent a value. For example, you would not want a variable meant to represent someone&#39;s name with an integer. . Questions (College Board&#39;s Essential Knowledge): . What exactly IS a variable? | What is the best data type to represent someone&#39;s dog&#39;s name? | Why is it important to give variables specific names before containing values? | What is the best way to represent someone&#39;s phone number? | Bonus (Not required but important to know): . How can we update a variable&#39;s value | What function is used to recieve a user&#39;s input? | Hacks . As your code becomes increasingly more complex, variables and their names will make reading and fixing your code easier. . Create code that... . Uses variables | Show your understanding of different variable data types by using at least 2 different types in your code | Uses meaningful names to prevent confusion | . Rubric . Code needs to function | Data types are properly used for their given function | Each variable has identification to prevent confusion | Each Variable is utilized for their intended purpose |",

The next question was incorrect was Q43, where it was asking for the value of X.

However, apparently you need 15 to get it correctly. I never knew. . . The next question that I got incorrect was Q44. This had to do with a MOD question. I did not know what mod was originally, but after searching it up (modulo), I think I can confidently answer this one in the future. . .

Their website is essentially a time based project that focalizes on the convenience of projecting the time for ANY Timezone in specific cities.

Next, a trip to the ceramics room! There were so many great crafts to marvel at, but the two things that caught my attention the most were the Gomu-Gomu-no-mi (Nika nika) and the lovely octopus. . The reason I loved the gomu gomu craft is because it is from one of my favorite shows of all time: One Piece. The attention to detail was immaculate and it is evident that they gave the swirls a definite value to add more detail. The attention to even the more minute details were amazing, and additionally the creator managed to create a convenience factor into their craft, making it capable of holding multipe small items and liquids! . .",

Making this quiz was fairly simple, all I had to keep in mind were what I wanted to implement on the test and how I would record the score if someone picked the wrong answers. On top of my pondering, I also wanted to have a sound based test that would have audio play if you got the question wrong rather than a screen that directed you to whether the question was right or wrong. I used some audio files on my computer to create a yes and no audio. I decided that I would have a subtractive based code to determine one&#39;s score, with an initial score of 3, every question that the user gets wrong would subtact a point, therefore making the quiz viable for if you wanted to see the score or not. Either way, the only way to advance to the next question is if the answer selected is correct. I used the OnEvent command for most of it, and then set Screen. I had a lot of fun designing the layout of my quiz. I grabbed a bunch of images from my computer to add some personality to the quiz. . Furthermore, some part that was challenging during the making of the quiz was that recording the score took a longer time than designing the quiz. I had to make the variable x worth 3 and then for every wrong answer, make it so that the variable is lowered by one. I had a lot of fun making this quiz. .",
