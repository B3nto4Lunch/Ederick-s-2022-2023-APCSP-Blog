This is a very good example of a project where something is not entirely explained and the points greatly hinder it. The Program Purpose and Function, Algorithm Implementation, and Testing were all done well, but the Data Abstraction, Managing Complexity, and Procedural Abstraction were &quot;half&quot; completed. Part of it was explained but the project was not specific enough to earn each the point. For example, in Procedural Extraction, it includes the two program segments but does nto specify how the procedure is used for the entire program and only states that it is used for smoothness. For my project, even though the procedure may have a functionality, the explanations must be good so that no points are completely lost during grading. . - College Board seems to agree with why the submission did not meet a specific standard - The program should have evident values that meet the criteria for each of the categories and must do a good job explaining the function and purpose. - See Paragraph Above .

This project was a great way to demonstrate how to get full points (according to College Board). Essentially, this project demonstrates how to input something into the program via text box to enter letters for a puzzle, where the output displays the letters/number of lives for every incorrect guess. Even with a set out plan, the project makes it better by adding very thorough and complete explanations of managing complexity to testing to the roles of every bit of code. Overall a very strong project and something that should be kept in mind for the individual projects given to us. . - College Board seems to agree with why the submission did not meet a specific standard - Theoretically, following this project and how it describes and elaborates on all of its details is a textbook example of a good response. Going for in depth to demonstrate the functionality will also be good - See paragraph above. . Submission 3 .

This project had a lot of things missing that would make it good. The project was essentially a program that would use a list of states and displaying output results ont he screen as a picture of the state flag + data about each one. However, the explanation about the codes were very incomplete and was overall very scuffed for each category. For example, the Data Abstraction does identifies the name of the variable in the list but fails to elaborate any further on what it represents. Additionally, this pattern seems to follow for the rest of the categories, where they state the value being identified but does not do a good job explaining the significance of the segment. Some segments like testing don&#39;t even identify the correct result/value/thing. - College Board seems to agree with why the submission did not meet a specific standard - Ensure that we define the program segments and algorithm, as well as elaborating on the testing and making sure all valued are identified correctly - See Paragraph above .

This project revolved around a boat and shows the input of said boat as the user inputs keystrokes. The output includes the movement of the vehicle and the score. Everything is explained correctly and all the criteria is met for all of the categories except for testing. The reason why none of the testing was met was because of the the response was not specific enough for the arguments that are passed through the parameters. Additionally, the response&#39;s conditions do not correlate to how the parameters are used in the program nd describes the code segments rather than the result of the call. . - College Board seems to agree with why the submission did not meet a specific standard (except for the Testing, I personally thought that the condition was correctly described) - Ensuring our testing is absolute is very crucial to how we complete our project with full marks. Everything else done fine, however, and is a good example of what to include in our response - See Paragraph above .",

The creation of our project should allow fitness to become more approachable for those that are concerned about their body health but are too afraid to take any action because of societal norms. | Adding goal planning with additional features encourages users to consistently exercising and to slice their big goal into smaller, more achievable goals. | Outside of fitness itself, using goal planning can help encourage users to do the same thing in addition to exercise (but continue to do so!): to maintain motivation. | Think of a Harmful Effect of Your Project . The project based on goal-planning may create too many goals, which may result in the nullification of the entire purpose of the project itself. When you clutter your entire workspace with too many things with the original purpose to split the big picture into smaller, more attainable pictures, it can lead to too much stress and can lead to demotivation because they cannot reach all their goals on time. | . Thoughts on Pros/Cons on Internet Blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school . Well, there are a lot of Pros when it comes to internet blockers. It helps students stay on task by prohibiting wandering access into game sites and downloading potentially harmful products for school computers. It also keeps track of all students&#39; histories. However, there are also a lot of downsides to having internet blockers. To address the white elephant in the room, the internet blockers have really been a pain to deal with when it comes to getting work in CS done. For example, the school, although in good intentions I&#39;m sure, prohibits AWS to avoid potential harmful effects. Additionally, even in this day and age, not everyone has a hotspot to loop over to get to their work done through school materials (or, in retrospect, people that have hotspots basically make the blockers useless). . Concerns on Digital Divide . Digital divide really does have a strong impact on students and districts based on economic statuses. For example, in much lower funded schools, people do not have access to decent computers that can accomplish tasks at decent rates and therefore cannot achieve optimal productivity, whereas somewhere like Del Norte has access to a well funded school and economic system where we are able to bring our own laptop (where many people in other places may not even have the money to afford personal laptops). This does an equal advantage to everyone and is a detriment for people&#39;s futures. . Additional Thoughts and Reflection . A lot of things have the capability to benefit or harm society in a variety of ways. For example, UAV and Drones are capable of delivering packages to peoples doors for more convenience and can be utilized for military play. However, they also breach privacy and can set forest fires and such. OPEN AI and ChatGPT are things as well, they can help find people get quick and easy access to information so that it is easier to get work done. However, on the flip side, they also contribute to people cheating and violating Academic Honesty. It really depends on the integrity of the user to not abuse the software. Overall though, if many people can cooperate with baseline rules when using these AI&#39;s, it will, without a doubt, benefit the evolution of technology and society as we know it. Some question I have though are: . For each software, how can baseline rules be implemented so that these softwares are not abused? (Example: create some security so that if someone asks &quot;How to make cocaine&quot; or anything along those lines the software will refuse to give any information) | How can schools use this technology to their advantage to help students enhance their academic and mechanical skill? | Can these softwares also become emotionally intelligent? Many people do not have anyone to talk to | Are these softwares more useful for anything outside of information gathering? Example: I want to become good at CS:GO or Valorant. Can the software give me advice to improve at said games for a specific character or gun mechanic? | .",

Does not really provide too many details about the subject, but rather it does do a decent job at explaining everything. This can work in my code, but I think that more details have to be more thorough to make sure no confusion is present and complexity is there. If not, vague answers and descriptions of our product may be a liability when actually finalizing it because we do not have a fully constructed blueprint. . Project 2 . [x] Program Purpose and Function | [x] Data Abstraction | [x] Managing Complexity | [x] Procedural Abstraction | [x] Algorithm Implementation | [x] Testing | . This student, similar to student one, did do a decent job describing everything... only it was much better. The student had more in depth composition and seemed like they knew what what they were talking about. Additionally, the student also implemented various pictures as blocks which can help visualize the code better. Additionally, their description is very complex and thorough and goes through most details. This is a good example of what I should be include in our code to reduce confusion. In my code, we should add lots of infographics and descriptions to reduce the amount of errors that might occur and have a more clear idea of what we are going to do. . Reflections for the Future . What would you code given absolute freedom? It&#39;s hard to say what the ultimate thing I would want to code would be, but something that can help me and others and potentially become a source of revenue would be ideal. Because of this, I think programming a video game would be the best way to exercise my coding because video games, such as League of Legends, generate lots of revenue through in game purchases and such and allows for socializing between people on the internet and provides a way of entertainment. Additionally, people that create content based around said video game can attract more users plus make the content creator more successful as well (through social media revenue and payouts). However, if video games was not an option, something more trivial like calculator apps and such that can still generate money would be ideal, where it helps people and still allows for a source of income. . What would motivate you to be productive each day given the freedom to code what you want? Well, to have motivation for that ultimate coding project, there needs to be an incentive, of course. Incentives will allow people to perform tasks to achieve said incentives. One popular incentive, and probably the most sought out, is money. That is the main incentive that would motivate me to continue working on said project. I don&#39;t want to just create something without compensation. Of course, I want to help those in need and create apps and code that can benefit society, but what&#39;s the point of creating said helpful apps if I am not rewarded for creating them? However, something that&#39;s just as important is the enjoyment. Even if I generate money from a project, I would still want to enjoy creating said project because I don&#39;t want to be miserable for the majority of my day. Together, with enjoyment and money, that should be enough to sustain my motivation to code my dream project. . How would you measure success in your team? Measuring success in a team can be measured in three main concepts. Firstly, and most important, is the team collaborating? Are they working together? If a team is not a team, then many errors can occur. No communication means that many mixups can occur (e.g One person updated frontend development that altered the backend, but failed to notify the backend developer, resulting in the crashing of the program or code). Good collaboration almost always correlates to more success in a team&#39;s product. Secondly, is the program popular? Is it generating money? Money makes the work go &#39;round. Again, incentives are what motivate people and teams to continue their jobs and such. Money can go more in-depth, though. Money can help support families, live a lavish lifestyle, etc. If the team is constantly working on a project that does not generate any money, then the team will not be able to use it as a way to become more successful or at the very least, live more comfortably. Tax, mortgage, and student loans, all need money. That&#39;s why people have jobs and create projects, to generate money to pay off these horrors of today. Finally, does this team enjoy what they are doing? If you love your job, you will start to think of it less of a job and more of a hobby -- a hobby that generates money. The more the team enjoys what they are doing, the more willing they are to fix errors, apply updates, continue improving, their project. The best way to stop a man from escaping a prison is to make them think that they aren&#39;t in prison in the first place. . In a project, most students are more motivated if the project seems useful, unique, and has an interested consumer. How will you maintain motivation? I will maintain my motivation by continuously revising my incentives: money and enjoyment. I want to seek enjoyment in everything that I do and I hope that it will be useful for me in the future (whether I learn something or generate income) . Take a moment to review standards linked on this page. Provide summary in comment on why information is this blog is important?. Firstly, being agile, is extremely important because it helps increase the efficiency and the process of what we do can affect the amount of time it will take and the quality of life while performing tasks. Additionally, being open to change can make it easier to improve one&#39;s project, which can help consumers retain more engagement, increasing success. Building mutual interests with others can also help with creating a project because it demonstrates one&#39;s gregariousness and openess to improvement from others. This helps build the quality of team creativity and productivity. On another note, having commitment to a project and to overall improvement is extremely important. It shows your dedication and motivation towards a certain topic and will certainly aide in your willingness to collaborate and develop with others. Valuing creativity and quality in ones&#39; work will also help in the overall improvement of not just you, but the entirety of a team. . Would you rather work on PBL project, or or do assigned free-response coding questions (aka FRQs)? Which would be easier to meet class standards? PBL projects would allow for individual growth and show the process of trial and error and will help develop and grow as a person and how I can use PBL in daily life and other projects and classes. However, FRQs can be a little bit easier because there is generally a more concrete answer rather than the different ways one can develop and grow as a person through projects. . Trust and Freedom are often earned. How will you show your passion and ability to succeed in your work? Demonstrating one&#39;s commitment and dedication to their coding and projects shows their passion. While the ability to succeed in work may be a struggle at the start, the more I learn from others and the internet, the easier it becomes in the easier. The progress displayed throughout the assignment demonstrates a person&#39;s commitment and development as a student and as an individual. This, in turn, can allow for others to trust you with work more easily knowing that you will find a suitable way to fulfill said task. . What key learnings and focusses are a priority for you? Being open to collaboration and the willingness to improve and grow are a priority for me because the faster and better that I can develop and grow as a person, the more likely that my product will be successful in the future because I can utilize more complex features of code to implement into my program to perform more dedicated and specific tasks. .",

When you define a model in SQLAlchemy, you can create a new model that inherits from an existing model by specifying the base model class as a parameter to the new class. | . | init method the init method is a special method in Python classes that gets called when an instance of the class is created. It is also known as the constructor method. | . | . The purpose of the init method is to initialize the attributes of the object to their initial state.

Machine Learning Visit Tutorials Point . Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

Data Compression is the reduction in the number of bits needed to represent data and is used for time tramission saving and storage space. . When data is compression, you are essentially looking for repreated patterns and predictability. The larger a data file, the more patterns that can be pulled out of it. . Text Compression: Removing all repeated characters and inserting a single character or symbol to represent it is a sign of data compression. Ex: Twinkle, twinkle, little star can be replaced with, say &quot;S, S, little star.&quot; . Example: Unscramble. Humpty dumpty sat on a wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall, all the king&#39;s horses and all the king&#39;s mean, Couldn&#39;t put Humpty together again. . Image Compression: Photographs do have predictable patterns. Taking pixels and finding patterns between them canhelp compress the image by not sending every pixel individually. . Lossless: reduces the number or bits tored or transmitted while guaranteeing complete reconstruction of the original data. (Typical approach where the loss of words or nubers would change the info, ex: executable files, text) Lossy: significantly reduces the number of bits stored or transmitted but only allow reconstruction of an approximation o fthe original data. (The typical approach where the removal of some data has little or no discernible effect on the representation of the content since the data removed are redundant, unimportant, or imperciptible, ex: graphics) . Which is Better? . It dpeends on your needs. . Lossy can reduce the data more, but og data cannot be recovered | Lossless data compression lets you restore and recover og data but it cannot be compressed as much as lossy algorithms. | If quality is important, lossless | Having the smallest transmission time, lossly | Just because compressing data, doesn&#39;t mean we lose more data! | . 2.3 CB Video Notes .

The green square will most likely result in lossy compression because it is a consistent colorl therefore you can save a lot more space when using lossy compared to lossless. The forest, on th. other hand, has many different shades and colors involved, so a lossless compression algorithm is preferred because the colors will not be averaged and make it look worse. .",

This night was very spectacular, and I think that there were many elaborate and complex pieces of art that were very inspiring and clearly required lots of time and effort doing. Here are some of the examples that I came across. . The first thing that I came across when touring all of the difference spectactles at the museum was the ceramics room. Ceramics has always been a very interesting elective to me, and I wish I could have taken it in Freshman year. However, a lot of people do tell me how difficult it is due to the amount of attention to detail and skill required to craft such spectacles. I came across this amazingly done squid. I thought it reminded me of a kraken! . . Next, onto the Photography class! This time, I went to my friend (and also star swimmer) Julien Rousseu! His sister drives kinda badly, so he took a hilarious photo of two cars, opposite in color, standing in the parking lot. Talk about the duality of opposites! Not only are they different colors and directions, they are also different brands! . . Finally, the moment you have all been waiting for! The Computer Science Projects! This time I viewed my friend Yuri’s food tracking project and a video game project! . The first project, Yuri’s project, has some amazing CSS and some amazing features. After logging in, all you have to do is search up what you want to cook, and all the recipes and DIYs will show up and can be stored in a DB! It is very complex and really demonstrates their time and effort! | The second project that I saw was an 8-bit arcade style based game, where you can play the iconic game, snake! Basically, a snake is controlled by the player and its goal is to collect all the food (red bits) until the snake is either too long to move anywhere or it hits the wall or collapses in on itself. There is also a really cool leaderboard and such that displays records, and because its retro, each user is only three letters (characters) long! | . . . Here’s a picture of me and my group at the Night of the Museum! Hope to see everyone there next time! . .",

If there is nothing present in any of the values, the program will prompt the user to fill in all variables before filling in. . 3aiii: The inputs of the program are what the user types into the form, where the Difficulty must be an integer whle the Goal and Date are strings.

Additionally, the specificity for each of the cateogires prevents confusion and therefore also manages complexity. Additionally, there are more parts that manage complexity, such as Modularity: The code is divided into functions with specific tasks, such as read_goal(), createGoal(), and add_row(), which makes it easier to understand and maintain. . . 3c(iii): This function, keep in mind, is used from the list that is created with the backend data (as shown in images above) and uses that to convert into the table with the according variables. . 3civ: the program uses nested statements to get the desired result, for example, if the user’s inputs invalidate any of the errors, the prompt will ask them to fix them before creating. . 3d . . As shown from the code, this function is known to the program as “add_row” and is applied to the button that creates said data. The function will intake all of the user’s inputs, and after the backend has it, will post it as a part of the table. This program also has selection by giving options between whether formatting is valid or invalid, and iterates by checking whether any progress has been made to satify these requirements, which is then put as a sequence. Additionally, after the error check process is finished, we have another function, “read_goal” that essentially takes the data created and places it in the table. . 3dii: There also conditions for said functions. One, of which, is checking for whether the user’s input is a string or a integer. Depending on one of the columns, a notifcation will pop up and will prompt the user to fix said errors before putting in the correct data. . Results are the user’s inputs being displayed in the table. . .",

A long time ago, when I played an older competitive game known as CS:GO (Counter Strike Global Offensive), there was this lottery system where you would spend some money for a chance to get a skin. However, these skins would range from a variety of things, from the &quot;condition of the skin&quot; to the color waves and such, which could then be traded for real life money. Thus, a CSGO lottery system has been created. I really wanted skins because I wanted to partake in this economy. However, some famous youtubers actually hosted this website where you would gamble for skins, but in reality it was rigged and you would essentially lose real life money in the form of gun skins. Luckily for me, I did not have any money to afford this, so I was fortunately left out.

Google: Face Book vs TikTok Agegroup: The data suggests that the average age of a TikTok user is significantly younger than the age of the averange Face book user. This does make a lot of sense, however. Facebook was created many years ago, where many adults today back then as adolescents that needed a form of social media used facebook, and simply did not want to transition platforms after newer medias like Twitter and TikTok came out. Facebook is still a good profitable business, but is nowhere near its original monetary value increase. | . | Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Many different virtual assistants like Amazon, Alexa, Google, Apple Siri, all have female voices for many reasons. For one, I think many businesses think that the use of female voices makes the actual communication more coherrent, and this can be supported through the use of changing accents and languages. On top of that, I think that female is just a default option since you can create different other vocals, including male voices. | . | Algorithm tht influences decisions Algorithms like the For You Page (FYP) influence my decisions on a daily basis. For example, if I were to like episodes of X creator on tiktok, the algorithm will be like, &quot;Hey, this user likes X creator! Let&#39;s continue to post more videos similar to this creator&#39;s content&quot; to keep my attention span for longer, which is good for profit. | . | . HP Computers are Racist . Obviously, the owner/brand owner was unaware that this was going to happen. HP probably just had the camera focus on higher beams of light to recognize faces, which is why darker skinned individuals were undetected by the AI. If you were to single out an entire race, then that means unforgiving canceling (for social media platforms) and marketing purposes because you are noncoveraging a large chunk of the consumer market. If it WAS intentional though, that would mean that HP&#39;s reputation would be crippled and would end up creating many problems. I do not think HP is trying to ruin their reputation and harm users. Using a different algorithm to detect facial features of people to include the skin tone will make a more efficient method to detect facial features. To avoid Bias in our project, I think we should definitely include the different features that different people may have. Some of which include... .

Crowdsourcing provides the ability to obtain shared information, share information, and participate in distributed computing | Crowd sourcing CAN be inaccurate, but there are many editiorial teams that ensure the accuracy is good | Example: Crypto currency and the associated block chain have many exchanges of money that are validated at least 3 times a day by individuals daily. If there is a flaw the calculations are reiterated until done correctly. This makes it more reliable and impacts the affirmations of the government. | . Computer Science 150 students Question: Computer science has about 150 students. This means that there is a lot of information being spread around that associates with work and social communication through interactions with the students themselves and teacher. Crowd sourcing is a way of getting a job done by involving a larger party rather than an individual, meaning that data can be collected a lot easier. Because of this, if you have a certain party of students that are in charge of grading certain tasks, like if we have multiple hacks and a certain person is in charge of grading a certain portion, then that can allow for more efficiency. | . | Del Norte Crowdsourcing?: It is true that Del Norte has done a great job gathering information from many students using different methods, one of which may be surveys and self assessments. However, a problem with these statistics is that biasing may be involved, so it is important to make it so that the user is not pressured into saying something that is not true to put them in a better impression to the interviewer. Taking this into account, we need to be as transparent with our users as possible to make sure no response bias, noncoverage, or other outlier skews the user&#39;s data and affects their experience with our program. | . | How can we show this at N@tM? Well, we want to demonstrate our control over the data that we collect through our program. Using this data, we have to utilize it in as many ways possible to get an effective amount of advice and quality of life for the user for the smallest amount of data given. For example, if we ask for something simple, like their age, we can generate a lot of advice catered towards their age and can use that, paired with the dream goals, to create something to &quot;wow.&quot; | . | .",

Thoughts on Pros/Cons on Internet Blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school . Well, there are a lot of Pros when it comes to internet blockers. It helps students stay on task by prohibiting wandering access into game sites and downloading potentially harmful products for school computers. It also keeps track of all students&#39; histories. However, there are also a lot of downsides to having internet blockers. To address the white elephant in the room, the internet blockers have really been a pain to deal with when it comes to getting work in CS done. For example, the school, although in good intentions I&#39;m sure, prohibits AWS to avoid potential harmful effects. Additionally, even in this day and age, not everyone has a hotspot to loop over to get to their work done through school materials (or, in retrospect, people that have hotspots basically make the blockers useless). . Concerns on Digital Divide . Digital divide really does have a strong impact on students and districts based on economic statuses. For example, in much lower funded schools, people do not have access to decent computers that can accomplish tasks at decent rates and therefore cannot achieve optimal productivity, whereas somewhere like Del Norte has access to a well funded school and economic system where we are able to bring our own laptop (where many people in other places may not even have the money to afford personal laptops). This does an equal advantage to everyone and is a detriment for people&#39;s futures. . Additional Thoughts and Reflection . A lot of things have the capability to benefit or harm society in a variety of ways. For example, UAV and Drones are capable of delivering packages to peoples doors for more convenience and can be utilized for military play. However, they also breach privacy and can set forest fires and such. OPEN AI and ChatGPT are things as well, they can help find people get quick and easy access to information so that it is easier to get work done. However, on the flip side, they also contribute to people cheating and violating Academic Honesty. It really depends on the integrity of the user to not abuse the software. Overall though, if many people can cooperate with baseline rules when using these AI&#39;s, it will, without a doubt, benefit the evolution of technology and society as we know it. Some question I have though are: . For each software, how can baseline rules be implemented so that these softwares are not abused? (Example: create some security so that if someone asks &quot;How to make cocaine&quot; or anything along those lines the software will refuse to give any information) | How can schools use this technology to their advantage to help students enhance their academic and mechanical skill? | Can these softwares also become emotionally intelligent? Many people do not have anyone to talk to | Are these softwares more useful for anything outside of information gathering? Example: I want to become good at CS:GO or Valorant. Can the software give me advice to improve at said games for a specific character or gun mechanic? | .",

            "content": "Agile Manifesto . Create a project that satisfies the teachers expectations and the developers | Have a product that goes above and beyond the project criteria and is beneficial to others | Don&#39;t worry about making mistakes! Mistakes are learning opportunities! | We will respect each others time and commitment and strive to be reliable and meet the deadlines on time | Support and encourage each others personal and professional growth | . Project 1 . [x] Program Purpose and Function | [x] Data Abstraction | [x] Managing Complexity | [ ] Procedural Abstraction | [x] Algorithm Implementation | [x] Testing | . Does not really provide too many details about the subject, but rather it does do a decent job at explaining everything. This can work in my code, but I think that more details have to be more thorough to make sure no confusion is present and complexity is there. If not, vague answers and descriptions of our product may be a liability when actually finalizing it because we do not have a fully constructed blueprint. . Project 2 . [x] Program Purpose and Function | [x] Data Abstraction | [x] Managing Complexity | [x] Procedural Abstraction | [x] Algorithm Implementation | [x] Testing | . This student, similar to student one, did do a decent job describing everything... only it was much better. The student had more in depth composition and seemed like they knew what what they were talking about. Additionally, the student also implemented various pictures as blocks which can help visualize the code better. Additionally, their description is very complex and thorough and goes through most details. This is a good example of what I should be include in our code to reduce confusion. In my code, we should add lots of infographics and descriptions to reduce the amount of errors that might occur and have a more clear idea of what we are going to do. . Reflections for the Future . What would you code given absolute freedom? It&#39;s hard to say what the ultimate thing I would want to code would be, but something that can help me and others and potentially become a source of revenue would be ideal. Because of this, I think programming a video game would be the best way to exercise my coding because video games, such as League of Legends, generate lots of revenue through in game purchases and such and allows for socializing between people on the internet and provides a way of entertainment. Additionally, people that create content based around said video game can attract more users plus make the content creator more successful as well (through social media revenue and payouts). However, if video games was not an option, something more trivial like calculator apps and such that can still generate money would be ideal, where it helps people and still allows for a source of income. . What would motivate you to be productive each day given the freedom to code what you want? Well, to have motivation for that ultimate coding project, there needs to be an incentive, of course. Incentives will allow people to perform tasks to achieve said incentives. One popular incentive, and probably the most sought out, is money. That is the main incentive that would motivate me to continue working on said project. I don&#39;t want to just create something without compensation. Of course, I want to help those in need and create apps and code that can benefit society, but what&#39;s the point of creating said helpful apps if I am not rewarded for creating them? However, something that&#39;s just as important is the enjoyment. Even if I generate money from a project, I would still want to enjoy creating said project because I don&#39;t want to be miserable for the majority of my day. Together, with enjoyment and money, that should be enough to sustain my motivation to code my dream project. . How would you measure success in your team? Measuring success in a team can be measured in three main concepts. Firstly, and most important, is the team collaborating? Are they working together? If a team is not a team, then many errors can occur. No communication means that many mixups can occur (e.g One person updated frontend development that altered the backend, but failed to notify the backend developer, resulting in the crashing of the program or code). Good collaboration almost always correlates to more success in a team&#39;s product. Secondly, is the program popular? Is it generating money? Money makes the work go &#39;round. Again, incentives are what motivate people and teams to continue their jobs and such. Money can go more in-depth, though. Money can help support families, live a lavish lifestyle, etc. If the team is constantly working on a project that does not generate any money, then the team will not be able to use it as a way to become more successful or at the very least, live more comfortably. Tax, mortgage, and student loans, all need money. That&#39;s why people have jobs and create projects, to generate money to pay off these horrors of today. Finally, does this team enjoy what they are doing? If you love your job, you will start to think of it less of a job and more of a hobby -- a hobby that generates money. The more the team enjoys what they are doing, the more willing they are to fix errors, apply updates, continue improving, their project. The best way to stop a man from escaping a prison is to make them think that they aren&#39;t in prison in the first place. . In a project, most students are more motivated if the project seems useful, unique, and has an interested consumer. How will you maintain motivation? I will maintain my motivation by continuously revising my incentives: money and enjoyment. I want to seek enjoyment in everything that I do and I hope that it will be useful for me in the future (whether I learn something or generate income) . Take a moment to review standards linked on this page. Provide summary in comment on why information is this blog is important?. Firstly, being agile, is extremely important because it helps increase the efficiency and the process of what we do can affect the amount of time it will take and the quality of life while performing tasks. Additionally, being open to change can make it easier to improve one&#39;s project, which can help consumers retain more engagement, increasing success. Building mutual interests with others can also help with creating a project because it demonstrates one&#39;s gregariousness and openess to improvement from others. This helps build the quality of team creativity and productivity. On another note, having commitment to a project and to overall improvement is extremely important. It shows your dedication and motivation towards a certain topic and will certainly aide in your willingness to collaborate and develop with others. Valuing creativity and quality in ones&#39; work will also help in the overall improvement of not just you, but the entirety of a team. . Would you rather work on PBL project, or or do assigned free-response coding questions (aka FRQs)? Which would be easier to meet class standards? PBL projects would allow for individual growth and show the process of trial and error and will help develop and grow as a person and how I can use PBL in daily life and other projects and classes. However, FRQs can be a little bit easier because there is generally a more concrete answer rather than the different ways one can develop and grow as a person through projects. . Trust and Freedom are often earned. How will you show your passion and ability to succeed in your work? Demonstrating one&#39;s commitment and dedication to their coding and projects shows their passion. While the ability to succeed in work may be a struggle at the start, the more I learn from others and the internet, the easier it becomes in the easier. The progress displayed throughout the assignment demonstrates a person&#39;s commitment and development as a student and as an individual. This, in turn, can allow for others to trust you with work more easily knowing that you will find a suitable way to fulfill said task. . What key learnings and focusses are a priority for you? Being open to collaboration and the willingness to improve and grow are a priority for me because the faster and better that I can develop and grow as a person, the more likely that my product will be successful in the future because I can utilize more complex features of code to implement into my program to perform more dedicated and specific tasks. .",

            "title": "MCQ 2 Test Corrections",
            "content": "This test, I got a 38/50, and these are all the questions that I got incorrect. I will go into detail on my thought process and how I can correct myself to not make these mistakes in the future. . Q1: This had to do with initial values that yield the incorrect value of max. I put &quot;B,&quot; but the correct answer was D. My thought was that if Y was the highest value, then the incorrect value would be displayed. Looking back at the problem though, however, I realize why my thought process made no sense and decided that the best course of action would be to redo it. This was a fairly simply problem that I made a callous mistake. . Q8: I got one of the point right, where I said A and B, when the correct answers were A and D. I knew that the difference between borrows and returns is zeros, but I thought that since the borrows and returns are correlated with each other, the product of the two should theoretically be even, but then I forgot the multiplication can make odd numbers still, so that is why D is the correct answer. . Q13: I put B, I and II, but the answer was II and III only (D). Looking at the problem I see why. If someone is equal to or older than 16, then that means that they can be 18, and therefore satisfy both inequalities and still be able to vote and drive. . Q20: This question is incorrect. I put C for &quot;flip_counter=2.&quot; IN the simulation, the variable flip_counter represents the number of times a coin was flipped. When the counter equals 2, only two coins could have flipped. This info does not lead to knowledge about the result of the simulation. Looking back at it, I think I should have gotten this problem correct, but I simply misread (maybe I was going to fast). Obviously, the flip counter tracks the amount of times the coin itself is flipped, but I mistook it for the amount of times heads was chosen. If heads is 2, that means that the other two HAVE to be tails. I need to make sure to read all of the answer choices correctly. . Q23: I was really confused on what this question was asking me. Looking at it, apparently they were trying to tell me what value is supposed to result in the execution of the algorithm (to stop), which of course would be 5. I thought it was asking me about all of the possible choices needed to create the outcome to be five until the algorithm finished, so I put C, 1234. . Q27: This question was also really simple. I chose A, but this outcome is incorrect because we put the initial value of n as 1. That means when n = n + 1, the first thing will be repeated 2 times rather than 1, resulting in it being the incorrect answer. The actual correct answer was D, where it gets rid of that that command and only adds 1 to n AFTER all the previous commands are ran. . Q28: I got one of the answers right and the other was wrong. The correct answer was A and C, but I put A and D. I thought D would work because C looked like it would repeat the movements 8 times, and would create a box. after drawing it out, I see that it actually makes sense because it moves forward and then turns left, but then since the final direction of the robot is facing a different direction, it can actually get to its intended destination. . Q32: I chose A for this, where Program I would work and II did not. In actuality, the two programs works, not just one. In program II, the value of i starts at na nd finishes at 1, so that result stores the sum of n + (n-1) ... + 3 + 2 + 1. Which is literally just backwards version of Program 1, that adds 1 + 2 + 3 ... + n. . Q39: This was a robot problem. I originally thought that the answer was B, but the actual answer is C. I understand why this so after taking a second glance. Because the robot can ONLY turn right, if I make it turn once (i thought it was turning back left), It will end up crashing into a wall. This makes sense and I have to understand constraints that exist. . Q41: I also totally understand why I got this problem wrong. I forgot how python works, where when choosing RANDOM, if I do random(1,10) = 2, that is only a 1/10 because it will be randomized for a certain number, and that number is 2. However, I thought that it meant to choose 2 votes, but that is not the case. I needed to choose D, where &lt;= 2 means 1 and 2 or possibilities, which is now 20% . Q45: This question is simply me misunderstanding heuristic approaches towards predicaments. I thought that the problem needs to be solved in a reasonable amount of time and a approximation is acceptable, but apparently the problem cannot be solved in a reasonable amount of time and an approximate solution is acceptable. . Q48: Simply changing line 7 and 8 will make it so that the sum will only be calculated once. I did not really understand this problem because the code given was kind of confusing. But after knowing the answer, I now understand why it is more effective and therefore reduced the amount of operations performed. .",

            "content": "Outline for Goal Planning . Firstly, for goal planning, I wanted to create something that would correlate and synchronize with my teammates. So, I created &quot;Goal-Planning,&quot; which is something that can interact with my teammate Steven&#39;s workout calendar. Brief Overview: My page, the goal planning, helps users record and split their final goal into smaller, more achievable goals to encourage progress in &quot;doing better than last time,&quot; whether it be for mentality or physical fitness. There will be three input boxes for the user to fill in: . The name of the goal | How hard they would rate it on a scale of 1-10 | WHEN do you want to achieve said goal (This aligns with Steven&#39;s calendar because I want the goals to hopefully appear on the calendar when said goal is recorded) | . These goals will then be stored somewhere (DB, Dictionary, etc.) and will be logged in a &quot;goal box.&quot; I will make sure to make each goal editable and an &quot;x&quot; button to remove any goals to remove clutter. Whenever the data is changed, the program will send the data as a compilation of lists to backend, which should save in the SQL DB. This also ensures that when the user clicks off or is returning to a page, the data is correctly updated to each specific goal. . The video that is in production demonstrating this feature will include the creation, editing, and removal of each goal and how it updates (in sync with the calendar hopefully). Here is a brief outline so far: . CB Scoring . Purpose: To set small, attainable goals for users to help them step by step to help them achieve their ultimate goal . | 2a. .

The feature I will be using will be a function that goes along the lines of &quot;sort,&quot; which will aid the user in selecting one specific goal if the user is struggling to determine whether they want to progress on A or B. | . | 4b.

Additionally, the entire response did not include any solution to managing complexity and the use of a list does not satisfy what College Board wants. Procedural Abstraction also was somewhat off, where the parameter did not really comb in to satisfy what College Board wants. (Correction: CB said they got this point).

Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

            "content": "Unit 2 Vocabulary Terms . Bits, Bytes, Hexadecimal / Nibbles . Bits - A given byte contains either bits or a code. A designation of &#39;bits&#39; means that each individual bit has its own meaning, independent of the meaning of other bits in the byte. | Byte - code is computer object code that an interpreter converts into binary machine code so it can be read by a computer&#39;s hardware processor. | Hexadecimal - relating to or using a system of numerical notation that has 16 rather than 10 as its base. | Nibble - a nibble is four consecutive binary digits or half of an 8-bit byte. | . . Unsigned Integer, Signed Integer, Floating Point . Unsigned Integer - Unsigned Integers (often called &quot;uints&quot;) are just like integers (whole numbers) but have the property that they don&#39;t have a + or - sign associated with them | Signed Integer - A signed integer is a 32-bit datum that encodes an integer in the range [-2147483648 to 2147483647]. | Floating Point - There are two floating point primitive types. Data type float is sometimes called &quot;single-precision floating point&quot;. Data type double has twice as many bits and is sometimes called &quot;double-precision floating point&quot;. | . . Binary Data Abstractions: Boolean, ASCII, Unicode, RGB . Boolean - True or False statements | ASCII - ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet. | Unicode - an international encoding standard for use with different languages and scripts, by which each letter, digit, or symbol is assigned a unique numeric value that applies across different platforms and programs. | RGB - Red Green Blue (Gamer) | . . Data Compression: Lossy, Lossless (note discussed yet) . Lossy - Lossy is a data encoding and compression technique that deliberately discards some data in the compression process. | Lossless - With lossless compression, every bit of data originally in a file remains after it is uncompressed, and all the information is restored | . Unit 2 Vocabulary Terms . Unit 3 Vocabulary Terms . Variables: A variable is an abstraction made inside a program that holds a value. These variables are used in code to refer to more complex values that the variable contains and makes the program code more organized and smoother to run. | Data Types: Variables have different data types that store specific kinds of data depending on what is being represented. Some examples are shown below: integer (numbers) | string (or text/letters) | Boolean (True/False statements) | . | Assignment Operators: Collegeboard uses &lt;– as the assignment operator. The assignment operator looks different for different types of coding languages A variable will take the most recent value assigned | Lists: Lists are sequences of elements with each element being a variable. An example of a list can be the names of the students in this classroom. | 2D Lists: A two-dimensional list can be considered as a matrix where each row can have different lengths and supports different data types. | Dictionary: Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates. | Class: a class is a template definition of the method s and variable s in a particular kind of object | Algorithms: An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a task, it can be expressed by natural language, diagrams, and various other ways. | Sequence: The order that the steps go in of a Algorithm | Selection: A selection allows an algorithm to make a decision based on if a condition is met. It&#39;s like a boolean True or False statement or a set of options that will determine the next step. | Iteration: An iteration is a loop and doing something again until a condition is met, like how something will continue to be checked for each item in a list until a condition is met. | Expressions: An expression in Python is a combination of operators and operands. It is like an equation or something that defines a variable&#39;s value. | Comparison Operators: Signs like &lt; and &gt; and = that compare the values of variables and other things to determine the next step in their algorithm. | Booleans Expressions and Selection: Based on the Boolean&#39;s True or False, it will make a selection | Booleans Expressions and Iteration: Based on the Boolean&#39;s True or False, it will iterate something in the algorithm or not. | Truth Tables: A truth table has one column for each input variable (for example, p and q), and one final column showing all of the possible results of the logical operation that the table represents. | Characters: Alternatively referred to as the character set, charset, and character encoding, a character code describes a specific encoding for characters as defined in the code page. | Strings: Basically just text, but it can be something like a sentence, not just a single letter or word. | Length: Determines the length of a string or a list or a variable or whatever the length of x is. | Concatenation: returns a single string consisting of str1 followed by str 2 (concat(str1,str2)) | Upper and Lower Definitions: A top-code for a variable is an upper limit on all published values of that variable. Any value greater than this upper limit is replaced by the upper limit or is not published on the micro-data file at all. Similarly, a bottom-code is a lower limit on all published values for a variable. | Traversing Strings: String Traversal. Traversing a string. Traversing just means to process every character in a string, usually from left end to right end. | Python Conditionals: if: If something is equal or not equal to or meets this conditional: do this | elif: if the following if statements do not meet the conditions, try this statement instead. | Else: if something meets the conditionals do this, otherwise do this (else). (if this is 1 say Hello, Else say goodbye) | Nested Conditionals: It&#39;s like another conditional for if else statements, where if it does this, do it, else: if this... else that.x = 3 y = 2 if x = y print(&quot;x = y&quot;) else: if x &lt; y: print(&quot;x &lt; y&quot;) else: print(&quot;x &gt; y&quot;) . | . | Python For, While loops with Range, with list For: The for statement can help access every single definition in the list. For example, if I had a list that had multiple values and I wanted each thing to be evaluated by my code, I would use the for item. Example Below.listA = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 100] for item in listA: if item &gt;= 5: print(&quot;Greater than 5&quot;) else: print(&quot;Less than 5&quot;) . | While Loops with Range: While basically just means that &quot;while the thing that you are assessing meets this condition, keep doing it until it doesn&#39;t&quot;. Range is simply used to define how many times you want something to repeat. | Lists: The two things above can be used with lists. Again, to reiterate, the for function is basically used to assess every value in the less rather than just a single variable at a time because lists can hold multiple values and the for and while functions work to help the user. | . | Break: The Break function is basically where you want to create a loop that follow the code, unless it does this, then break or in other words, stop the code. | Continue: Similar to the break function, the continue does the exactly opposite, where if you want the code to stop, but then once another condition is met, you can use continue to continue running the code. Example will be below:for i in range (1,40): if i == 20: break print(i) . | Procedural Abstraction: Procedural abstraction is when we write code sections (called &quot;procedures&quot; or in Java, &quot;static methods&quot;) which are generalized by having variable parameters. The idea is that we have code which can cope with a variety of different situations, depending on how its parameters are set when it is called. | Python Def Procedures: . A procedure allows us to group a block of code under a name, known as a procedure name. A procedure is a named set of instructions that can take in parameters and return values. It may be called &quot;method&quot; or &quot;function&quot; in different programming languages. Example:def multiply(x, y): product = x * y return product . It is basically like a function to do this two the two parameters (which are independent variables to be filled with defined values) instead of constantly doing something like z = x * y and then printing Z. Using def is a lot more efficient and the python code below will show examples. Returning what you want see from it is also needed, so like, if I wanted to multiply x and y, I want to return, or see, the product. | Parameters: Parameters are independent variables used in the procedure to produce a result. It allows a procedure to execute without initially knowing specific input values. | Return Values: To use return values, you have to write the syntax return followed by the expression you would like to return var. A return statement exits a function and instructs python to continue executing the program and to return a certain value. | . Everything Defined: Variables, Data Types, Assignment Operators Managing Complexity with Variables: Lists, 2D Lists, Dictionaries, Class Algorithms, Sequence, Selection, Iteration Expressions, Comparison Operators, Booleans Expressions and Selection, Booleans Expressions and Iteration, Truth Tables Characters, Strings, Length, Concatenation, Upper, Lower, Traversing Strings Python If, Elif, Else conditionals; Nested Selection Statements Python For, While loops with Range, with List Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue Procedural Abstraction, Python Def procedures, Parameters, Return Values . def multiply(x,y): product = x * y return product a = 5 b = 10 c = 12 d = 15 x = 17 y = 2 multiply(x, y) multiply(c,b) multiply(a,y) multiply(c,d) ### Instead of creating multiple variables that are the result of var1 and var2 and having to print it out, we can save some time by creating these functions. . 180 .",

Topic 3.13 (3.B): . Explain, in your own words, why abstracting away your program logic into separate, modular functions is effective Abstracting the program logic into separate, modular functions is effective because it can make independent parts that can be used in other parts of the code, which is more efficient than just reprinting the code over and over again (it&#39;s also more time efficient). | . | Create a procedure that uses other sub-procedures (other functions) within it and explain why the abstraction was needed (conciseness, shared behavior, etc.) | Add another layer of abstraction to the word counter program (HINT: create a function that can count the number of words starting with ANY character in a given string -- how can we leverage parameters for this?) | . print(&quot;welcome to a shop&quot;) print(&quot;shirts are 5, pants are 10&quot;) shirt = 5 pants = 10 def shirtply(s): return s * 5 def pantsply(s): return s * 10 def tax(s): return s * 0.08 print(&quot;How many shirts did you buy?&quot;) x = int(input()) print(x) print(&quot;That alone will be&quot;, shirtply(x)) print(&quot;How many pants did you buy?&quot;) y = int(input()) print(&quot;That will be&quot;, pantsply(y)) print(&quot;All together, that will be&quot;, (shirtply(x) + pantsply(y))) print(&quot;Your tax will be&quot;, tax((shirtply(x) + pantsply(y)))) print(&quot;Have a good day!&quot;) . welcome to a shop shirts are 5, pants are 10 How many shirts did you buy? 5 That alone will be 25 How many pants did you buy? That will be 60 All together, that will be 85 Your tax will be 6.8 Have a good day! . Explanation . I created two functions that basically totalled the value for a particular amount of clothing that the person bought. Because of this, it shortened the amount of time that it took to code as I did not have to create new variables to find the value of how much the shirts, pants, and tax instead of simply typing something as simply as &quot;tax()&quot; Below is what the code would be without the defined sub procedures. . print(&quot;welcome to a shop&quot;) print(&quot;shirts are 5, pants are 10&quot;) shirt = 5 pants = 10 print(&quot;How many shirts did you buy?&quot;) x = int(input()) print(x) prod = x * 5 print(&quot;Your total for those items alone with be&quot;,prod) print(&quot;How many pants did you buy?&quot;) y = int(input()) prod2 = y * 10 print(&quot;That will be&quot;, prod2) print(&quot;All together, they will be&quot;, (prod + prod2)) print(&quot;Your tax will be&quot;, ((prod + prod2)*0.08)) print(&quot;Have a good day&quot;) . There are a lot more variables that are scattered throughout the code, which can make it way too confusing for someone in the future. Just having something as simple as shirtply() is a lot easier to read. Less errors will occur and it is more organized. . def split_string(s): # use the split() method to split the string into a list of words words = s.split(&quot; &quot;) # initialize a new list to hold all non-empty strings new_words = [] for word in words: if word != &quot;&quot;: # add all non-empty substrings of `words` to `new_words` new_words.append(word) return words # this function takes a list of words as input and returns the number of words # that start with the given letter (case-insensitive) def count_words_starting_with_letter(words, letter): count = 0 # loop through the list of words and check if each word starts with the given letter for word in words: # use the lower() method to make the comparison case-insensitive if word.lower().startswith(letter): count += 1 return count # this function takes a string as input and returns the number of words that start with &#39;a&#39; def count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(s): # use the split_string() function to split the input string into a list of words words = split_string(s) # use the count_words_starting_with_letter() function to count the number of words # that start with &#39;a&#39; in the list of words count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, &quot;a&quot;) return count # see above def count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(s): words = split_string(s) count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, &quot;d&quot;) return count def letter_count(s): words = split_string(s) count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, letter) return count letter = input(&quot;What is your letter?&quot;) # example usage: s = &quot; This is a test string!

Words starting with a: 1 Words starting with d: 1 Words starting with t : 4 . I added some code to make it so that you can choose what input is given. For example, all you need to do is type the letter you want to be counted in the sentence (&quot;This is a test string! Don&#39;t you think this is cool?&quot;). I did t, so it gave 4 . Below is the added to the code . # The code counts the letters that start with the user&#39;s input def letter_count(s): words = split_string(s) count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, letter) return count letter = input(&quot;What is your letter?&quot;) # Prints the result print(&quot;Words starting with&quot;, letter, &quot;:&quot;, any_count ) . An alternate way you could do that allows for a unique string to be counted is shown below (very similar to the code used in the example) . def count_input_character (input_str, character): input_str = input_str.lower() character = character.lower() count = 0 for i in range (0, len(input_str)): if input_str[i] == character and (i == 0 or input_str[i - 1] == &quot; &quot;): count += 1 return (count) input_str = input(&quot;Enter a string: &quot;) print(input_str) character = input(&quot;What character do you want counted?&quot;) print(character) result = count_input_character(input_str, character) print(&quot;words starting with&quot;,character, &quot;:&quot;,result) .

They create a simulation where in each location that their posters are placed, 1 in every 200 people will call the business/product and 1 in every 1300 people will buy the business/product. They have the populations for every location their advertisements are in and run it.

The simulation is, well, a simulation is because the results that the dice outputs will not always be the same and therefore it emulates that of real life. | . | What are it’s advantages and disadvantages? The advantage is that the results that the computer outputs can be more time efficient, and can save money (if someone is being payed and such to roll the dice at random). However, the dice game may not be as accurate as a real life demonstrate because of some variable or factor (like the face the dice is being rolled at, height above the surface, etc.) | . | In your opinion, would an experiment be better in this situation? In my opinion, the dice as a simulation would be better because you can receive a large amount of data from the simulation that would otherwise be similar to an experiment -- random -- and in addition save some time. | . Hack #4 . Add a feature onto the rolling dice simulation above ex: a 14-sided dice or expand the purpose of the simulation (hint: use conditionals to make dice part of a game/real life situation) I added conditionals similar to something like a casino, the place where dice are used the most Below are the conditionals used in the simulation . for item in roll_results: if item == 1 or item == 6: print(&quot;Oh!

Continuous learning is somethin that is really important because it can get boring sometimes, so constantly learning can make the experience more enjoyable and therefore will get you furthr ahead in life and have some more passion to it! | Taught Python to himself | . Questions . Different companies have their own version of Agile and they will adjust depending on what they need from their employees. . The concept of &quot;agile&quot; is so important, where some projects could be due in 6 months, 8 months, and you really need to be flexible to adjust the workflow according to the time | . | Are you still working at Twitter? . Kris: No, I am going to go work for something called (Kristin Lab?? Sorry I can&#39;t hear very well). | . | Can you go more in depth into machine based learning? Kris: It&#39;s kind of like utilizing the python libraries provided and the ability to run experiments. So, the only project that I did at Qualcomm, we used something like GitLabs, and we had a 100,000 something repositories, and we were very concerned with who is pushing/pulling/downloading what, so we had management over that and used the information to predict when to archive and when to do something, which often times can cost money. Lots of petabytes being used and bought by Qualcomm, yeah. | . | Data sciences can still be used in a non technical form/word | What do you think is the most important skill to have in the tech industry? Kris: The most important to me is overtime, is the continuous learning. I think it is very important, where you are not just learning about particular programming, but a lot of you guys will be going into engineering classes and careers, and its just that thing about learning to learn. Do not be too concerned on what&#39;s on the news. The only risk that I have is not learning while in that job when I&#39;m taking that job offer. Everything else kinda falls into place when you&#39;re continuously learning. | Kathyleen: Yeah, continuous learning is very important. You know, zigzagging, is kind of useful, but if I develop more skills, maybe I can use it to help people that do not possess [some of the skills I have]. Some of the best technical people that I have worked with have listened, Listening is very important and solving the given requirements is very important. If you can help explain it to someone else, that is really something else. | . | Biggest Challenge in the Tech Industry? Kathyleen: When I worked at Qualcomm, you know how it&#39;s a semi conductor? Yeah, it went through acquisitions. Qual is a very big fish in the pond and it was something that I had to work with/adapt to. You have to be adaptive in the work environment. | Kris: The hardest thing, I would say, would, well, besides interviews, basically would be for Silicon Valley jobs would be a series of random test questions that you did not know what it was and being able to pass those tests are hard! | . | Make sure that you can be flexible with your colleges because sometimes there are other factors that can affect your day to day life. | How do you think that tech knowledge can help in other various jobs that do not have to do with software engineering? Kathyleen: Problem solving and stuff can really help in any work environment. You are in a room, no phone, no computer, no electronics, just a pen and a pencil. How many cars do you think were sold in the US last year? I don&#39;t wanna know the answer, I just want to know the assumptions that you made. (I missed a lot sorry, tired hands) | . | Some jobs do not require the strong use of AWS | How does coding help with investment and finance? Kathyleen: I think that if you understand coding, understanding those algorithms can help understand the solution to these problems. | . | Takeaway, Conclusion, What I Learned . Coding and Tech are crucial, not just in their aspects, but they can help with other tasks and strategies that are derived and utilized in other parts of my life. One example is continuous learning, where no matter where or when because it helps develop and grow as a person. Kris stated that progressing and improving are important, because if you stunt your learning growth while at a job, then the job probably is not suitable (one, you are not constructing better mechanics, and two, the job will because dull and meaningless). Other skills that can help with other things are: being able to communicate with others and being flexible, and adjusting to your workflow. Being able to accomplish due dates and such on time is a struggle in addition to having the functionality to adapt to conditions. Even though I may not pursue computer science in the future, I can still utilize the knowledge that I have learned to make my job easier .",

Explain, in your own words, why abstracting away your program logic into separate, modular functions is effective Abstracting the program logic into separate, modular functions is effective because it can make independent parts that can be used in other parts of the code, which is more efficient than just reprinting the code over and over again (it&#39;s also more time efficient). | . | Create a procedure that uses other sub-procedures (other functions) within it and explain why the abstraction was needed (conciseness, shared behavior, etc.) | Add another layer of abstraction to the word counter program (HINT: create a function that can count the number of words starting with ANY character in a given string -- how can we leverage parameters for this?) | . print(&quot;welcome to a shop&quot;) print(&quot;shirts are 5, pants are 10&quot;) shirt = 5 pants = 10 def shirtply(s): return s * 5 def pantsply(s): return s * 10 def tax(s): return s * 0.08 print(&quot;How many shirts did you buy?&quot;) x = int(input()) print(x) print(&quot;That alone will be&quot;, shirtply(x)) print(&quot;How many pants did you buy?&quot;) y = int(input()) print(&quot;That will be&quot;, pantsply(y)) print(&quot;All together, that will be&quot;, (shirtply(x) + pantsply(y))) print(&quot;Your tax will be&quot;, tax((shirtply(x) + pantsply(y)))) print(&quot;Have a good day!&quot;) . welcome to a shop shirts are 5, pants are 10 How many shirts did you buy? 5 That alone will be 25 How many pants did you buy?

I created two functions that basically totalled the value for a particular amount of clothing that the person bought. Because of this, it shortened the amount of time that it took to code as I did not have to create new variables to find the value of how much the shirts, pants, and tax instead of simply typing something as simply as &quot;tax()&quot; Below is what the code would be without the defined sub procedures . print(&quot;welcome to a shop&quot;) print(&quot;shirts are 5, pants are 10&quot;) shirt = 5 pants = 10 print(&quot;How many shirts did you buy?&quot;) x = int(input()) print(x) prod = x * 5 print(&quot;Your total for those items alone with be&quot;,prod) print(&quot;How many pants did you buy?&quot;) y = int(input()) prod2 = y * 10 print(&quot;That will be&quot;, prod2) print(&quot;All together, they will be&quot;, (prod + prod2)) print(&quot;Your tax will be&quot;, ((prod + prod2)*0.08)) print(&quot;Have a good day&quot;) .

Three components of an Algorithm: . Selection | Sequence | Iteration | . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still create the same thing. . It is important to notice the differences in the algorithms to see if there are any errors that can occur . Tommy and Billy are working on solving the same issue with an algorithm Tommy creates a functioning code and yells &quot;I did it!&quot; He looks over at his friend Billy which is having a bit of trouble and he offers help However, Billy&#39;s code looks basically the same! which confuses them Then they remember that they were taught that algorithms that look similar don&#39;t always have the same results and they collaborate to do further investigation:) . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) A = grade &gt;= 90 B = 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90 C = grade &lt; 70 if A: print(&quot;Wow!

The code above does look different from the first two, but it is the same thing, where instead of the number being identified, it is being identified through the letter that it is given. Does the same thing, but uses a different method to find said grade. . Developing Algorithms . When creating an algorithm, it is good to outline its process before coding to ensure that it is sequenced correctly (the steps taken to derive your answer) . Visualization helps one see the flow of the whole algorithm | More efficient and effective | . . Algorithms with iteration repeat functions until a goal is fulfilled. . Algorithms with selection will only go through certain functions if certain things are true or false . An example of visualization is shown below . Start | Input number of hours parked | If hours is less than 1, cost is free | If hours is between 1 and 2, cost is $5 | If hours is between 2 and 3, cost is $8 | If hours is between 3 and 4, cost is $10 | If hours is more than 4, cost is $12 | Display cost and goodbye | Finish | print(&quot;The parking rate is as follows: n Less than one hour: Free n 1-2 hours: $5 n 2-3 hours: $8 n 3-4 hours: $10 n 4+ hours: $12&quot;) time = float(input(&quot;How many hours have you parked at this garage?&quot;)) print(&quot;How many hours have you parked at this garage?&quot;) print(time, &quot;hours costs:&quot;) if time &lt; 1 : print(&quot;Free&quot;) elif time &gt;= 1 and time &lt; 2 : print(&quot;$5&quot;) elif time &gt;= 2 and time &lt; 3 : print(&quot;$8&quot;) elif time &gt;= 3 and time &lt; 4 : print(&quot;$10&quot;) else: print(&quot;$12&quot;) print(&quot;Have a good day!&quot;) . Notice how the algorithm is planned out before creating, making it more efficient and less prone to errors. . To use preexisting algorithms, knowing some can help construct new ones . simple existing algorithms include determining the min and max of 2+ numbers | Computing sum or average | identifying if an integer is even or odd Using existing algorithms structures can help as building blocks to reduce the time to develop, testing, and errors. | . | . Binary Search . The binary search algorithm starts at the middle of a sorted data set of numbers and eliminates half of the data; this process repeats until the desired value is found or all elements have been eliminated. However, data must be sorted order to use this algorithm (set of instructions to solve something) | Binary searching is oftentimes more efficient than sequential/linear search when applied to sorted data. | . Computers line up values in order and search sequentially down the line, one at a time. This is called a sequential search because each element in a list is examined starting with the first element until we find the desired target or reach the end of the list. The elements do not need to be in any order to do a sequential search. If you are searching for a number in the middle of 7 values, it would take four comparisons to find it. . Steps for Binary Search . 1. Start by placing the numbers in order (ascending or descending, both work). 2. Look at the middle number first 3. The middle number is determined by taking the highest index (the order of it) number and the lowest and divide by two. If we have 7 numbers placed in order, the first and last&#39;s places are added together, so 1+7/2 = 4. If the number is greater than the middle it will take the middle of the middle index and last index and will continue in this process. . This is similar to Divide and Conquer If you have 600 sorted numbers. you would go in this process 600/2 = 300(middle) 300/2 = 150 150/2 = 75 (Always round up) 75/2 = 38 19/2 = 10 5/2 = 3 3/2 = 2 2/2 = 1 &lt;-- the answer . You can also conduct a binary search on lists with words in alphabetical order. For example, . Fruit = [&quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Banana&quot; , &quot;Kiwi&quot;, &quot;Mango&quot; , &quot;Strawberry&quot;] To find Mango you need to go to the middle and look at Kiwi and then Mango second, it is the arithmetic of the index number that will determine the element you are looking at. . 3.12 and 3.13 . procedure: a named set of instructions that can take in parameters and return values. It can also be called method or function in different programming languages. . Parameter: independent variables used in the procedure to produce a result It allows a procedure to execute without initially knowing specific input values . Return Function in Python . To determine the result of a procedure or any code, you must follow the code line by line and see what each one does . Using syntax, you can determine the result by . function parameters return value and statements To use return values, you have to write the syntax return followed by the expression you would like to return var A return statement exits a function and instructs python to continue executing the program and to return a certain value . Value can be string, a tuple, or any other type that is being sent back to the main program . Ex: . We use the Return function will assign the values for the variables. Try it below with and without the return result. The code basically defines the function as find_cube(num), but in order for it to update it the result, we use the return (variable) for it . return (&quot;what is being called, in this case the result&quot;)(this is also called the parameter) . def find_cube(num): result = bin(num * num * num) return result cube = find_cube(3) cube2 = find_cube(4) print(&#39;Cube:&#39;,cube) print(&#39;Cube:&#39;,cube2 ) . Cube: 0b11011 Cube: 0b1000000 . Modularity - the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program | Abstraction - the practice of hiding the details of how a particular code or system works and exposing only the essential features or functions that are necessary for other parts of the program to use | Duplication - having multiple duplicate code blocks, often decreasing readability and efficiency | Logic - the sequence of steps and operations that a computer follows to | . Parameters are used to manage complexity calling functions with procedure names . Vocab . Procedure: a module of code that is created to complete a certain tasks, also known as a function | Procedure Name: the name that is given to the function/procedure | Parameter: a variable (independent) that is used in a function to allow for data to be important into said function | Arguments: A way to provide information to a function usually defined outside a function and then important into a function with parameters. | . Example Below: . def function(a,b): # function is defined print(a+b) # prints output of variables function(1,2) # one instance that it can be used function(2,3) # another instance . 3 5 . a and b are the parameters . def InchestoFeet(inches): Feet = inches/12 return Feet result = InchestoFeet(24) print(result) . 2.0 . Vocab for the Week 2 . Bits, Bytes, Hexadecimal / Nibbles . Bits - A given byte contains either bits or a code. A designation of &#39;bits&#39; means that each individual bit has its own meaning, independent of the meaning of other bits in the byte. | Byte - code is computer object code that an interpreter converts into binary machine code so it can be read by a computer&#39;s hardware processor. | Hexadecimal - relating to or using a system of numerical notation that has 16 rather than 10 as its base. | Nibble - a nibble is four consecutive binary digits or half of an 8-bit byte. | . . Unsigned Integer, Signed Integer, Floating Point . Unsigned Integer - Unsigned Integers (often called &quot;uints&quot;) are just like integers (whole numbers) but have the property that they don&#39;t have a + or - sign associated with them | Signed Integer - A signed integer is a 32-bit datum that encodes an integer in the range [-2147483648 to 2147483647]. | Floating Point - There are two floating point primitive types. Data type float is sometimes called &quot;single-precision floating point&quot;. Data type double has twice as many bits and is sometimes called &quot;double-precision floating point&quot;. | . . Binary Data Abstractions: Boolean, ASCII, Unicode, RGB . Boolean - True or False statements | ASCII - ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet. | Unicode - an international encoding standard for use with different languages and scripts, by which each letter, digit, or symbol is assigned a unique numeric value that applies across different platforms and programs. | RGB - Red Green Blue (Gamer) | . . Data Compression: Lossy, Lossless (note discussed yet) . Lossy - Lossy is a data encoding and compression technique that deliberately discards some data in the compression process. | Lossless - With lossless compression, every bit of data originally in a file remains after it is uncompressed, and all the information is restored | .",

A variable is an abstraction inside a program that holds a value, where each variable has associated data storage that represents a single value at a time (However, if the value is a collection type such as a list, then the value can contain multiple values). | Variables typically have meaningful names that helps with the overall organization of the code and understanding of what is being represented by the variables | Some programming languages provide a variety of methods to represent data, which are referenced using variables (Booleans, numbers, lists, and strings) | One form of a value is better suited for representation than another. | . What is a Variable? . A variable is an abstraction made inside a program that holds a value. These variables are used in code to refer to more complex values that the variable contains and makes the program code more organized and smoother to run. . Variables can be seen as &quot;containers&quot; and each container has a name that holds what it is supposed to hold. In the following code, we can see that a variable has the value of &quot;Alex.&quot; How can we make the variable appear more organized in the code? . x = &quot;Alex&quot; print(x + &quot;likes pie.&quot;) # Make it so that &quot;x&quot; is easier to identify to the user . Choosing Variables . When choosing variables, it is important to assign the variables name to something that correlates with what the function of the variable is supposed to do. For example, we do not want a variable that is supposed to hold a name be named &quot;age&quot; becaue it can be confusing and mistakes may be more prevalent. . age = &quot;Timothy&quot; name = &quot;39&quot; # Notice how age is going to be seen when printing the code. That can lead to confusion print(name + &quot; is &quot; + age) . 39 is Timothy . Data Types . Variables have different data types that store specific kinds of data depending on what is being represented. Some examples are shown below: . integer (numbers) | string (or text/letters) | Boolean (True/False statements) | . These types of data types can be useful when trying to represent a value. For example, you would not want a variable meant to represent someone&#39;s name with an integer. . Questions (College Board&#39;s Essential Knowledge): . What exactly IS a variable? | What is the best data type to represent someone&#39;s dog&#39;s name? | Why is it important to give variables specific names before containing values? | What is the best way to represent someone&#39;s phone number? | Bonus (Not required but important to know): . How can we update a variable&#39;s value | What function is used to recieve a user&#39;s input? | Hacks . As your code becomes increasingly more complex, variables and their names will make reading and fixing your code easier. . Create code that... . Uses variables | Show your understanding of different variable data types by using at least 2 different types in your code | Uses meaningful names to prevent confusion | . Rubric .

I got this wrong because I chose 6 because I thought the repeating values would be enough to make x = x + 1 multiple times until x would be more than 5. However, apparently you need 15 to get it correctly. I never knew. . . The next question that I got incorrect was Q44. This had to do with a MOD question. I did not know what mod was originally, but after searching it up (modulo), I think I can confidently answer this one in the future. . . The last question that I got wrong was question 50, where I hadto understand concat values. I am still confused on how to do this function properly, but hopefully I will understand it in the future .",

            "content": "Today was such a great night at Night of the Museum. The first project that I encountered was my good friend Yuri Subrammamium. “We call it Baboon Juice Club.” says Yuri (‘The among us lord and savior who is rich but uses a razer huntsman mini smh’ -Yuri). . Their website is essentially a time based project that focalizes on the convenience of projecting the time for ANY Timezone in specific cities. Additionally, Yuri’s program also enables the user to have access to an alarm clock and stopwatch features. The alarm clock is such a life saver because I’m such a sleepy head! Wow! such a great looking site, the frontend sure does look amazing! I will definitely look into https://dnhstime.com and use it in the future!!! . A quote from the master Yuri himself: “Sometimes you just gotta eat a burger to finish.” . . Our program was a calendar scheduling program and it displayed the weather on specific days. You can click on specific days on the calendar and add events there with a popup. Additionally, the program will then sort the dates that you made for each day and put them into a list on the side and display them accordingly by date. You can search up the weather in any city as well. . In the computer 3d animation’s room, this student created such beautiful artwork. It shows the depiction of many different colors clashing with each other. The view of the sky is also amazing; it gives off a very welcome-y vibe! Props to whoever created this piece of art because it really reflects their effort throughout this entire trimester. It is unfortunate I could not see other work done by them. . . Next, a trip to the ceramics room! There were so many great crafts to marvel at, but the two things that caught my attention the most were the Gomu-Gomu-no-mi (Nika nika) and the lovely octopus. . The reason I loved the gomu gomu craft is because it is from one of my favorite shows of all time: One Piece. The attention to detail was immaculate and it is evident that they gave the swirls a definite value to add more detail. The attention to even the more minute details were amazing, and additionally the creator managed to create a convenience factor into their craft, making it capable of holding multipe small items and liquids! . .",

Making this quiz was fairly simple, all I had to keep in mind were what I wanted to implement on the test and how I would record the score if someone picked the wrong answers. On top of my pondering, I also wanted to have a sound based test that would have audio play if you got the question wrong rather than a screen that directed you to whether the question was right or wrong. I used some audio files on my computer to create a yes and no audio. I decided that I would have a subtractive based code to determine one&#39;s score, with an initial score of 3, every question that the user gets wrong would subtact a point, therefore making the quiz viable for if you wanted to see the score or not. Either way, the only way to advance to the next question is if the answer selected is correct. I used the OnEvent command for most of it, and then set Screen. I had a lot of fun designing the layout of my quiz. I grabbed a bunch of images from my computer to add some personality to the quiz. . Furthermore, some part that was challenging during the making of the quiz was that recording the score took a longer time than designing the quiz. I had to make the variable x worth 3 and then for every wrong answer, make it so that the variable is lowered by one. I had a lot of fun making this quiz. .",
