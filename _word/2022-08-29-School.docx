HOW TO USE VEGAS PRO

Many of the utilities in Vegas Pro are used mainly for longer content for
consumers to indulge in. However, there are features that can be used
to improve the overall quality of the content being made.
Some things that can help that do not require third party plugins are:
Velocity
Crossfade
Splice
Text
Audio Control
Resample

Of course, more advanced transitions exist in this, but to get really decent
camera transitions, third party software plugins are preferred because you have 
more control over the speed, intensity, and color arangement of the transition.
For example, if I want to have a quick blurred camera shake, I can use
saphire plugins for a more fluid transition than what Vegas offers.
Usually having another after-effects software can vastly improve the quality of
your content.
