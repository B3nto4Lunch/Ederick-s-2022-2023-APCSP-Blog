    "- A software library contains procedures that can be used in the creation of new programs.\n",
    "- Existing segments of code can come from internal or external sources, ie. libraries or previously written code.\n",
    "- The use of libraries simplifies the task of creating complex programs.\n",
    "- Application program interfaces (APIs) are specifications for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used.\n",

    "##### Defining a Library\n",
    "\n",
    "- A library is a collection of code from an external source that can be used to add functionality to a program.\n",
    "- Libraries are very useful, as they can be used to save time and effort in the development process.\n",
    "- Libraries are usually included in a program using a special keyword called \"import\" This keyword tells the program to look for the library and use its code.\n",

    "1) Randomization generates a value between two numbers. For example RANDOM(1,3) may result as 1 or 2 or 3, either one of those.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Now if we look into our day to day life we can see that randomization is all around us."
