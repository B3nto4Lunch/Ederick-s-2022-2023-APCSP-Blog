This can work in my code, but I think that more details have to be more thorough to make sure no confusion is present and complexity is there. If not, vague answers and descriptions of our product may be a liability when actually finalizing it because we do not have a fully constructed blueprint.\n"

    "This student, similar to student one, did do a decent job describing everything... only it was much better. The student had more in depth composition and seemed like they knew what what they were talking about. Additionally, the student also implemented various pictures as blocks which can help visualize the code better. Additionally, their description is very complex and thorough and goes through most details. This is a good example of what I should be include in our code to reduce confusion.\n",
