    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, this code shows procedural abstraction. Procedural abstraction is a programming concept that involves breaking down a program into smaller, more manageable tasks, each of which can be executed as a procedure or function. In this code, each function (display_books, add_book, update_book, and delete_book) represents a specific task or operation that can be performed on the database, and each function encapsulates the details of that operation. This allows the main program or other parts of the program to interact with the database using a simple function call, without needing to know the details of how the operation is performed. Procedural abstraction helps to simplify complex programs and makes them easier to maintain and modify."
