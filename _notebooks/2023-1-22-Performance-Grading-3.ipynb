    "This is a very good example of a project where something is not entirely explained and the points greatly hinder it. The Program Purpose and Function, Algorithm Implementation, and Testing were all done well, but the Data Abstraction, Managing Complexity, and Procedural Abstraction were \"half\" completed. Part of it was explained but the project was not specific enough to earn each the point. For example, in Procedural Extraction, it includes the two program segments but does nto specify how the procedure is used for the entire program and only states that it is used for smoothness. For my project, even though the procedure may have a functionality, the explanations must be good so that no points are completely lost during grading.\n",

    "This project was a great way to demonstrate how to get full points (according to College Board). Essentially, this project demonstrates how to input something into the program via text box to enter letters for a puzzle, where the output displays the letters/number of lives for every incorrect guess. Even with a set out plan, the project makes it better by adding very thorough and complete explanations of managing complexity to testing to the roles of every bit of code. Overall a very strong project and something that should be kept in mind for the individual projects given to us.\n",

    "    This project had a lot of things missing that would make it good. The project was essentially a program that would use a list of states and displaying output results ont he screen as a picture of the state flag + data about each one. However, the explanation about the codes were very incomplete and was overall very scuffed for each category. For example, the Data Abstraction does identifies the name of the variable in the list but fails to elaborate any further on what it represents. Additionally, this pattern seems to follow for the rest of the categories, where they state the value being identified but does not do a good job explaining the significance of the segment. Some segments like testing don't even identify the correct result/value/thing.\n",

    "This project revolved around a boat and shows the input of said boat as the user inputs keystrokes. The output includes the movement of the vehicle and the score. Everything is explained correctly and all the criteria is met for all of the categories except for testing. The reason why none of the testing was met was because of the the response was not specific enough for the arguments that are passed through the parameters. Additionally, the response's conditions do not correlate to how the parameters are used in the program nd describes the code segments rather than the result of the call.\n",
