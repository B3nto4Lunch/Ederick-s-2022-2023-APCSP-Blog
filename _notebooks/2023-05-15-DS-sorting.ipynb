It will then do this process through the entire list, which will not always get it to sort correctly the first cycle. So multiple iterations are requried to get it to work.\n",
    "- Selection Sort: Very similar to how we do it naturally, selection sort takes the lowest value and puts it to the end through swapping. It will find the desired value and swap with the smallest index. It will find the next smallest/biggest value and swap it into the second index. It continues until the list is completely and properly sorted. This is like how we sort, where we organize the smallest value and it put it first, then find the next and put it second.\n",

    "- Merge Sort: Merge sort splits the array into multiple subarrays, preferrably in two. It will then arrange each subarray into order, and then merge the two subarrays into a slightly larger subarray and sort accordingly. Keep repeating this process until it is back into a full array, where it will be fully sorted by the time it rearranges. If there is an odd amount of elements, this will not affect the array and will simply just have one subarray with three elements rather than two.\n",
    "- Insertion Sort: Similar to bubble sort, insertion will take the element and iterate it through the list and checks the values on whether they need to be swapped or not. The difference between it is that the iteration happens for each individual element rather than iterating through the entire list like bubble sort.\n",

    "        - Lists and Dictionaries in python are not considered to be primitive types, but rather collection types. Primitive types refer to the utmost bsaic building blocks of Python (examples include intergers and strings). These types are not composed of other data types and are typically immutable (const). However, lists and dictionaries are collection types because they are able to hold multiple values and objects. Lists are ordered collections of elements, where each is assigned an index from 0 to n-1. Dictionaries are unordered collections of value pairs and each element is unique by a key, and the corresponding values can be anything.\n",
    "    - Is the list passed into bubble sort \"pass-by-value\" or \"pass-by-reference? Describe why in relation to output.\n",
