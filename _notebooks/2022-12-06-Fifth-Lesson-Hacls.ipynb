    "1. Why is it important to know that algorithms that look different can do the same thing and that algorithms that look the same might have different results?\n",
    "    - It is important to know that algorithms that look different can do the same thing because there are a multitude of different methods and structures that can be used to receive the same answer. For example, in the examples given in the presentation, there are different methods that were used to derive similar results. One used if and else statements to find out which conditions best suited the predicament. The other one simply used factors A, B, and C to categorize the value given, and although both displayed the same result, different inputs may result in different outcomes (outputs).\n",
